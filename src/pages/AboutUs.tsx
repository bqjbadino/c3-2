                        <p>Barqia Sports was born as a result of the merger of an Argentine company, known as Barqia, and a Spanish one, Padel Fantasy. Our contact occurred thanks to participation in a reference event for startups and entrepreneurs at an international level. After several months of conversations, reflections and exchange of passions, we had the extraordinary idea of ​​founding Barqia Sports, a comprehensive fan engagement platform. We share the same common interests and aspirations, focused on the application of cutting-edge and futuristic technology for the benefit of clubs, athletes and fans, with the purpose of creating a fully immersive platform with absolute connectivity between all the parties involved.</p>
